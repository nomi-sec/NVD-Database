Such a user, with the required system knowledge, could use this material to decrypt in-flight communication. b. The vulnerability requires administrative access and shell access to the EdgeConnect appliance. An admin user can access IPSec seed and nonce parameters using the CLI, REST APIs, and the Linux shell. Resolution \u2022 EdgeConnect software has been modified to prevent users from accessing IPSec seed and nonce parameters using the CLI, REST APIs, and the Linux shell. \u2022 EdgeConnect software has been modified to allow customers to choose not to persist the IPSec seed for additional security.
