A remote attacker can successfully authenticate as any user and gain access to restricted VPN network resources when the gateway or portal is configured to rely entirely on certificate-based authentication.\n\nImpacted features that use SSL VPN with client certificate verification are:\n  GlobalProtect Gateway,\n  GlobalProtect Portal,\n  GlobalProtect Clientless VPN\n\nIn configurations where client certificate verification is used in conjunction with other authentication methods, the protections added by the certificate check are ignored as a result of this issue.\nThis issue impacts:\nPAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.17;\nPAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.11;\nPAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.5;\nPAN-OS 10.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 10.0.1."
