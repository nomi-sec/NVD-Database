The second call will not happen until all\ncomponents required by related sound card are present within the ASoC\nframework. With firmware failing to load during the PCI's deferred\ninitialization i.e.: probe_work(), no platform components are ever\nregistered. HDAudio codec enumeration is done at that point though, so\nthe codec components became registered to ASoC framework, calling\nsnd_hda_codec_device_init() in the process.\n\nNow, during platform reboot snd_hda_codec_shutdown() is called for every\ncodec found on the HDAudio bus causing oops if any of them has not\ncompleted both of their initialization steps. Relocating field\ninitialization fixes the issue."
