SIPLUS NET variants) (All versions < V3.3). The affected versions contain an open debug port that is available under certain specific conditions. The vulnerability is only available if the IP address is configured to 192.168.1.2. If available, the debug port could be exploited by an attacker with network access to the device. No user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability impacts confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the affected device. At the stage of publishing this security advisory no public exploitation is known."
